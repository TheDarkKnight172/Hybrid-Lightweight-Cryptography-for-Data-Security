# Hybrid-Lightweight-Cryptography-for-Data-Security
In this project, we proposed an improvement to an existing hybrid cryptography method by integrating dynamic RSA with the newly developed ASCON lightweight cryptography. This algorithm was implemented using Python and Python libraries. This innovative approach not only enhanced security but also accelerated the encryption and decryption processes.
