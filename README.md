# Hybrid-Lightweight-Cryptography-for-Data-Security
In this research work, we propose an improvement to a previously existing hybrid cryptography method where we use dynamic RSA and newly developed ASCON lightweight cryptography. This not only increases the security but also speeds up the process of encryption and decryption
